# **Didactic PSU**

**An efficient finals project**

So, @nicogela and I decided to build a LAB PSU, but because we're lazy people and we don't like to carry weight we're tring to unite the high efficiency of the switching topologies to the high stability and low noise of the linear ones.

Up until now we've designed the linear stage, and we added to it some DACs in oreder to controll it with a uC. The next stage in the design process will be the testing of the linear + the dacs. If everithing works we will go ahead adding to the desing the switching stage.
